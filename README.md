# PUSH_SWAP TESTERIZER
Little tester for push_swap
This tests the 'checker', and the 'push_swap' runnables, then perform statistics
## How to use
 - change your project path in the Makefile
 - if you already used this tester for a project, run `./testerizer.sh re`
 - otherwise, run `./testerizer.sh`
 - stop current test with CTRL+C, quit with CTRL+\
 - results are outputed to 'test_results' and 'test_stats' files
 - other .sh files are used by testerizer.sh and the makefile, you are not expected to use those.
## Disclaimer
 - Failing tests does not mean you are wrong, you should investigate.
 - This tester does not test everything. It is not enough for an evaluation.
 - Im currently working on this tester.
